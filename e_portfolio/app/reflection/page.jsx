            The Personal Career Keys assessment report, a quite interesting take on assessing my individual career path and possibilities that can better suit me. Upon reading my PCK results, it would seem that there did contain some surprises on how it assesses me as an individual. Firstly, I expected the characteristics of realistic and investigative as the first but it seems my characteristics were deemed conventional and investigative. So crucial pieces for my future career may involve me leaning towards more standardized work and free for me to test out my ideas as well. So far my skills in arithmetic, verbal, and spatial seem to align to what I envision myself to be fast at. I also seem to prioritize a good working environment and sense of achievement when doing the job.

          Knowing such capabilities as I’ve been evaluated on, the suggested jobs seem to be jarring for my taste. Its understandable that my jobs are in zone 4 and 5 as they need ample experience and time for an individual to be suitable in such a position. Although geophysical technician seems like a not so common job but is the recommended top choice for the PCK especially here in the Philippines. I personally have debts to pay for the scholarships and the additional educational training I may need in geophysical science in order to better complement my Computer Science abilities and skills. Although there are some other jobs that did catch my attention. Statistical assistant, financial analysts, and other adjacent data managers are jobs I can see that I can fairly enjoy.

          Overall, it's quite a surprising look on the many other available jobs that I haven’t looked at after being suggested by the PCK. Seems like I would like to pursue some more research on such jobs. I personally don’t think of myself staying till the end of my time. That said, these results help me find a good start on where my skill sets are put best and my interests are put in comfort. I would still also do my due diligence in searching more as there are always more uncertainties than what a simple evaluation test can get.
