          Throughout Students Affair Services, I&apos;ve honed in making myself more and more social and open to networking into more individuals. In SAS1000 I&apos;ve learned that my personality has been more and more inclined to being much more extroverted than I thought and my closeted emotions can sometimes get into the way of my mental health. During the group interviews, it opened me up to the first thought of having much better awareness of people&apos;s closeness in terms of emotions and challenges.

          Afterwards, sessions involved in SAS2000 has taught me important aspects of creating amazing networking business strategies, being more empathic on particular aspects of life, and negotiating skills. Enlightened me on the soft skills I need to go further in my career and solidify a much more healthy habit of socializing and network building. The lectures and people I&apos;ve met along the way did make me more developed as an individual and confident on what I&apos;ve been through and confident to support others on what they are facing.

          Overall, I think I get to be more perceptive of my own self-worth and my career. Making it my utmost duty to further exemplify my learned values and skills.

          Throughout this final phase, SAS3000, I&apos;ve gotten more insights on how the workplace works and what values my fellow batchmates were questioning. Both learning classes and career information sessions lent me a hand in creating a more solid plan on improving my skills and which to focus and present on my fields of resume. Instances like how Chevron caters to a variety of employee&apos;s always wants to hone in the fact that we should work hard and be ready to learn. What makes great productivity is through consistent adaptability. Making aspects of my own curiosity play a key role in igniting my passion and to continue in any company position.

          In the past, I usually like to think most things are streamlined and you have to excel very well in aspects of academics. But now, seeing people from different fields get  to the lows yet achieve the highest highs made me feel an eye-opening epiphany on how reality has more factors. Simple magic of how particular design issues of computer architecture of CPUs has a lot more nuanced than I realized during my attendance of Tech Talks. It is ok to deviate away and learn more than just my chosen course. It really is an individual&apos;s effort to persevere.

          As such realization, I would like to be more fearless in trying. Of course trying things takes time, as time is of essence and money, I should practice in layering priorities in how I envision my time better. Although I am doing this, I&apos;ve garnered a newfound respect in the aspect of “trying things while young”. Many opportunities I can imagine passed by in my 1st and 2nd year and for the succeeding terms I have left, I wanna make the most of it and get ever closer to my ideas.

          Overall, these actions can lend me a better notoriety on my skills through the workspace. By understanding more and adapting to learn more I can speak the language of fellow professions. Like language and culture, getting to know one is just one thing, learning it is respecting it. Respect of such kind is especially important in places like companies and organizations that I would first find myself in.
